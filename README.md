# MongoDB chat


Hi welcome to my repo, here I want to sharp my node js backend skills by doing a chat application but now in Express JS, using Mongo DB,GraphQL and socket.io.

I think this will be challenging for me because I havent touched express js in a while, It's not dificult either as I've 
learned some stuff about mongo and I have a clearer understading about how websockets work thanks to my Laravel chat application practice.

The fundamental is the same, database is similar to the one I used in my Laravel practice, but It's an pure NoSQL schema.

I'll let the diagrams below, I don't know if I'll do an UI also for this, but I can take advantage and apply the full MEVN stack using vue for that. It's gonna be fun.

# Mongo DB Dump Initial Schema:

I've included my mongo db initial schema, with just one insert per table.
